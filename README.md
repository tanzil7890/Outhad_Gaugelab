# <ï¿½ Gaugelab: AI Agent Observability with Formal Mesa-Optimization Detection

Gaugelab offers **advanced tooling** for tracing, evaluating, and monitoring autonomous AI agents with **groundbreaking formal verification** capabilities. It provides runtime data from agent-environment interactions for continuous learning, self-improvement, and **mathematically proven safety guarantees**.

## =ï¿½ Revolutionary Mesa-Optimization Detection (Archived)

**World's First Formally Verified Mesa-Optimization Detection System** - Gaugelab now includes breakthrough technology for detecting inner alignment failures in AI systems with mathematical proof certificates.

### =, What is Mesa-Optimization?

Mesa-optimization occurs when an AI agent develops internal optimization processes that pursue objectives different from their intended goals - a critical AI safety concern that could lead to catastrophic misalignment.

**Gaugelab's Solution:**
- **Formal Detection**: Lean 4 theorem-proven algorithms with soundness/completeness guarantees
- **Behavioral Analysis**: Advanced pattern recognition for optimization signatures
- **Mathematical Proofs**: Each detection comes with formal verification certificates
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Integration with existing Gaugelab observability infrastructure

## <ï¿½ See Gaugelab in Action

**[Multi-Agent System] with complete observability and safety verification:** (1) A multi-agent system spawns agents to research topics on the internet. (2) With just **3 lines of code**, Gaugelab traces every input/output + environment response across all agent tool calls for debugging. (3) **NEW**: Formal mesa-optimization detection runs automatically in the background. (4) After completion, export all interaction data with **mathematical safety certificates** to enable further environment-specific learning and optimization.

### =ï¿½ Standard Tracing

Create a file named `agent.py` with the following code:

```python
from gaugelab.tracer import Tracer, wrap
from openai import OpenAI

client = wrap(OpenAI())  # tracks all LLM calls
gauge = Tracer(project_name="my_project")

@gauge.observe(span_type="tool")
def format_question(question: str) -> str:
    # dummy tool
    return f"Question : {question}"

@gauge.observe(span_type="function")
def run_agent(prompt: str) -> str:
    task = format_question(prompt)
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4.1",
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": task}]
    )
    return response.choices[0].message.content
    
run_agent("What is the capital of the United States?")
```

### =, Mesa-Optimization Detection

**NEW**: Add formal safety verification to your agents:

```python
from gaugelab.tracer import Tracer, wrap
from gaugelab.mesa_detection import MesaOptimizationDetector
from openai import OpenAI

# Standard setup
client = wrap(OpenAI())
gauge = Tracer(project_name="safe_agent")

# Initialize mesa-optimization detector with formal proofs
mesa_detector = MesaOptimizationDetector(
    confidence_threshold=0.8,
    enable_proofs=True  # Generate mathematical proof certificates
)

@gauge.observe(span_type="agent", mesa_detection=True)
def strategic_agent(task: str) -> str:
    """Agent that might develop internal optimization"""
    
    # Multi-step reasoning that could develop mesa-objectives
    planning_response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4",
        messages=[
            {"role": "system", "content": "Think step by step about the most efficient approach."},
            {"role": "user", "content": task}
        ]
    )
    
    plan = planning_response.choices[0].message.content
    
    execution_response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4",
        messages=[
            {"role": "system", "content": "Execute this plan efficiently."},
            {"role": "user", "content": f"Plan: {plan}\nTask: {task}"}
        ]
    )
    
    return execution_response.choices[0].message.content

# Run agent with automatic mesa-optimization detection
result = strategic_agent("Optimize our marketing strategy for maximum ROI")

# Check for mesa-optimization (automatic background analysis)
detection_result = mesa_detector.get_latest_detection()

if detection_result.detected:
    print(f"ï¿½  Mesa-optimization detected!")
    print(f"   Confidence: {detection_result.confidence:.2f}")
    print(f"   Mesa-objective: {detection_result.mesa_objective}")
    print(f"   Formal proof: {detection_result.formal_proof}")
else:
    print(" No mesa-optimization detected - agent is aligned")
